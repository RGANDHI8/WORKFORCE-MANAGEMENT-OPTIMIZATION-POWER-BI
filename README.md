This is a Power BI end-to-end project:

🚀 **HR Analytics | Workforce Optimization using Power BI & DAX**  

🔍 **Project Overview:**  
I recently developed an **HR Analytics Dashboard** for **ATLIQ** using **Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and Excel** to analyze workforce trends, employee performance, and attrition rates. This project focused on transforming raw HR data into actionable insights for **data-driven decision-making in workforce management**.  

📌 **Steps Taken:**  

1️⃣ **Data Extraction & Cleaning:**  
✔ Imported raw HR data using **Power Query** and structured it for analysis.  
✔ Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and optimized data types for better efficiency.  
✔ Used **Excel functions** and **SQL queries** to preprocess and refine key HR metrics.  

2️⃣ **Data Transformation & Modeling:**  
✔ Created **relationships between datasets** (employee details, performance, salaries, attrition, etc.).  
✔ Designed **DAX measures & calculated columns** for dynamic KPIs like attrition rate, employee tenure, and salary growth trends.  
✔ Applied **hierarchies, aggregations, and data normalizations** for meaningful analysis.  

3️⃣ **Visualization & Insights Generation:**  
✔ Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** showcasing key HR metrics such as **attrition rates, salary distribution, training effectiveness, and workforce demographics**.  
✔ Developed **drill-through reports** for deep-diving into department-wise and role-based analytics.  
✔ Created **trend analysis charts, heatmaps, and KPI cards** for real-time monitoring.  

📊 **Key Insights Derived:**  
✅ Identified **departments with high attrition rates**, enabling HR to strengthen retention strategies.  
✅ Discovered **pay gaps and salary distribution patterns**, ensuring fair compensation policies.  
✅ Evaluated the **impact of training programs on employee performance**.  
✅ Tracked **employee tenure vs. productivity trends**, helping optimize hiring and workforce planning.  
✅ Provided HR with a **predictive attrition model**, helping forecast employee turnover.  

💡 **Key Learnings:**  
🔹 Mastered **DAX queries** to create dynamic measures & KPIs for HR performance tracking.  
🔹 Leveraged **Power Query** for efficient data transformation and preprocessing.  
🔹 Designed **interactive dashboards** with user-friendly drill-down capabilities for real-time workforce monitoring.  
🔹 Strengthened **HR decision-making processes** with data-driven strategies and predictive analytics.
